# 📊 Optimization of R&D Investment Decisions in the Era of AI – Case of the United States

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the research, data, and code for my Master's thesis:  
**"Optimization of R&D Investment Decisions in the Era of AI in the United States."**

The objective of this work is to analyze how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can optimize Research & Development (R&D) investment decisions from both **quantitative** and **qualitative** perspectives.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Quantify the impact of AI on the economic and technological performance of R&D projects.  
2. Identify the sectors and types of firms that benefit the most from AI adoption.  
3. Evaluate the level of concentration of AI-related patents in the United States.

## 🛠️ Methodology
This research uses a **mixed-methods approach**:
- **Quantitative analysis:**  
  - Descriptive statistics, econometric models (OLS, SARIMAX, Gradient Descent).  
  - Concentration measures (HHI, Gini index, Lorenz curves).  
  - Patent and venture capital data (2010–2024).  

- **Qualitative analysis:**  
  - Case study (Pfizer).  
  - Expert survey among R&D and venture capital professionals.

## 📊 Data Sources
- **OECD** – Research & Development statistics  
- **NCSES (NSF)** – U.S. R&D expenditure and researchers  
- **USPTO / WIPO** – Patent data  
- **World Bank** – Macroeconomic indicators  
- **OECD.AI** – AI-related policy and innovation data  

---

## 📈 Key Results
- AI adoption improves **resource allocation efficiency** in R&D.  
- High concentration of AI patents among large U.S. firms (tech & pharma).  
- Mixed impact across sectors: pharmaceutical and ICT lead adoption, while traditional industries lag.  
- Econometric models confirm a **positive correlation** between AI-related R&D investment and long-term innovation performance.
